# Hello World 

I'm hosted with GitHub Pages! Welcome to my personal repository.

## About Me

I'm Etsub Wendwosen, a passionate **Data Science** graduate student at the University of North Texas (UNT), with a **BA in Economics**. I have a strong background in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **statistical modeling**, and I'm actively expanding my expertise in these areas. My goal is to leverage data science to drive informed decisions and contribute to meaningful projects.

### My Skills:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA
- **Big Data**: PySpark, Hadoop
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud
- **Tools**: Jupyter, Git, Docker, VS Code

### Current Focus:
I'm working on several exciting projects, including:
- **Predicting CO₂ Emissions**: Using machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and ARIMA to predict CO₂ emissions across different countries using 200 years of historical data.
- **Hotel Reservation Management System**: Designing a relational database for hotel management systems to optimize reservations and customer data management.

### Interests:
- I'm a curious learner who loves **solving complex problems** using data. I’m particularly interested in **generative AI**, **high-performance computing (HPC)**, and **cloud-based solutions**.
- When I'm not coding or analyzing data, I love to dive into **game theory**, exploring topics like **Prisoners' Dilemma** and **Nash Equilibrium**.

### My Academic Journey:
- **Current Program**: MS in Data Science (Graduating May 2026)
- **Key Courses**:
    - *Big Data Analytics*
    - *Information Organization*
    - *Parallel Computing and HPC*
